# Jardim

Jardim is a simple, high customizable CMS admin interface. (Work in Progress)

The name `Jardim` is a portuguese translation of `garden`. As we now gardens
should be beautiful places with flowers, trees, plants, herbs and a lot of
nature assets organized and controlled by human architectures. Thats how we
think webpages should look like.

Jardim is the administration interface to build websites.
